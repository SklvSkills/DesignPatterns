# [Flyweight pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern)
In computer programming, the flyweight software design pattern refers to an object that minimizes memory usage by sharing some of its data with other similar objects. These patterns promote flexible object-oriented software design, which is easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.
