# [Immutable interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_interface)
In object-oriented programming, "immutable interface" is a pattern for designing an immutable object. The immutable interface pattern involves defining a type which does not provide any methods which mutate state. Objects which are referenced by that type are not seen to have any mutable state, and appear immutable.
