# [Singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)
In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a singular instance. The pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

# [Multiton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton_pattern)
In software engineering, the multiton pattern is a design pattern which generalizes the singleton pattern. Whereas the singleton allows only one instance of a class to be created, the multiton pattern allows for the controlled creation of multiple instances, which it manages through the use of a map.
