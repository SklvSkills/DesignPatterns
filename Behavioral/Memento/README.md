# [Memento pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern)
The memento pattern is a software design pattern that exposes the private internal state of an object. One example of how this can be used is to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback), another is versioning, another is custom serialization.
