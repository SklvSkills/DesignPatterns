# [Template method pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern)
The template method is a method in a superclass, usually an abstract superclass, and defines the skeleton of an operation in terms of a number of high-level steps. These steps are themselves implemented by additional helper methods in the same class as the template method.
